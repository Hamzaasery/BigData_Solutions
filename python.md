Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
In Python, the language itself takes care of many low-level details such as memory allocation, garbage collection, and other system-level tasks, which makes it easier for developers to write code that is more human-readable and easy to understand. Python has a concise and straightforward syntax that resembles natural language, which makes it easier to write and read code, even for non-programmers.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Python is a dynamically typed language because we do not need to specify or declare the datatypes of variables before initializing. 

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Very easy to learn and understand, has a vast collection of maching learning libraries.
Comparatively slow to other object oriented languages.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Machine learning, big data, web developement, data science.

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
In Python, a variable is a named location in memory that stores a value, such as a number, string, or list. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data in your program.
To declare a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to a name using the = operator. 

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
By using the input() function.

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
String

Q8. What is type casting?
It is the process in which the data type of a variable in changed into another, Eg str >> int, int >> float etc.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
In Python, it is possible to take multiple inputs from the user using a single input() function call, but the inputs would need to be separated by a delimiter, such as a space, comma, or semicolon.

Q10. What are keywords?
Keywords are special reserved words in python, that cannot be used as variables.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
We cannot use key words as variables as they are already reserved and has some functionality. For example, you cannot use the keyword SUM as a variable, as it is already attributed to a function.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
In Python, indentation refers to the whitespace at the beginning of a line of code, which is used to define the structure and hierarchy of the code. Indentation is used to group statements together into blocks, which are executed as a unit, and to indicate the scope of loops, functions, classes, and other program structures.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
By using the print or the return statement in a function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?
In Python, operators are special symbols or reserved words that perform an operation on one or more operands. 

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
The / operator performs normal division and returns a float, while the // operator performs floor division and returns an integer.
